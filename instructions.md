Big Corp API
===============

Overview:
------------

Your task is to build a web app with a read-only JSON api for 3 resources:
 - employees
 - departments
 - offices

you can use any framework 
or language for building your app.

### Data Sources

The data source for employees is the api:

https://rfy56yfcwk.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bigcorp/employees
it supports two ways of querying, with limit in offset

https://rfy56yfcwk.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bigcorp/employees?
limit=10&offset=20 (gets 21th through 31st record) or querying multiple ids
https://rfy56yfcwk.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bigcorp/employees?
id=3&id=4&id=5 (returns records with id=3, id=4, id=5)

The data source for offices and departments are the files offices.json, 
departments.json. These are the entire list of offices and departments, 
and you can just read all the data for each and keep it in memory in your app.


### API

Your app should support GET requests to two endpoints (list & detail) 
for each resource following a standard REST convention

detail e.g. /employees/1

list e.g. /employees

list should support query limit and offset to support pagination.

limit is the max number of records returned, and offset is the index at which to start.

for instance /employees?limit=10&offset=17 returns the 18th through 27th employee By
default, limit is 100 and the max limit is 1000

in addition, both methods should support a query parameter called expand that 
lets you expand data along paths of to-one relationships

There are four relationships that can be expanded:
- manager in employees (expands to employees )
- office in employees (expands to offices )
- department in employees (expands to departments )
- superdepartment in departments (expands to departments )

see the examples below for how this works.

#### Examples

    ]

    /departments/9?expand=superdepartment.superdepartment

    {
        "id": 9,
        "name": "Sales Development",
        "superdepartment": {
            "id": 6,
            "name": "Outbound Sales",
                "superdepartment": {
                    "id": 1,
                    "name": "Sales",
                    "superdepartment": null
                }
        }
    }


### Notes

There is no need to build any kind of POST or other write api. Also, there's no 
need to use a database or caching system of any kind for this problem.

### Evaluation Criteria
- Correctness
- Avoid overuse of employees api endpoint. For instance, requests like /employees?
limit=1000&offset=10000&expand=manager.manager.manager should not make thousands or
even hundreds of calls to the endpoint.
- Well designed APIs
- Well structured and reusable abstractions
